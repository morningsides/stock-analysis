# Challenge
### For this challenge we change the control flow of the AllStocksAnalysis VBA script. In the first draft it parses the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet(once we choose the correct year) for stock values from various cells and then adds the totals to the corresponding cells in the "All Stocks Analysis" sheet. Once it adds the totals it loops through the sheet again for the next stock value and does the same. This continues until all the stock values in the ticker index are exhausted. For the challenge we break up the control flow into 2 main parts. First, rather than having to loop through the sheet multiple times for stock values it loops through one time and stores the separate values for our 12 stocks in 3 separate arrays which are all indexed at 12 to match up with our tickers array (totalVolume(12),endingPrice(12), and startingPrice(12))  

### Once the first step is complete we then loop through our 4 arrays and display the information we gained in the first step. By breaking things up into 2 steps it makes the code easier to maintain because we can now add additional features to the second step if we wanted to and don't have to worry about how we are going to gather the raw data again since we have that covered now in the fist step.
